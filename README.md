# roboTHIx_X1
These are the packages for the robot platform X1 of the team 'roboTHIx'.
This version supports Noetic. Other versions are not tested so far.

# Preparation
Before you can use the roboTHIx X1 packages, you have to install external depended packages.

  * [`ds4_driver`](https://github.com/naoki-mizuno/ds4_driver) to use a PlayStation 4 gamepad
  * [`phidgets_drivers`](https://github.com/ros-drivers/phidgets_drivers/tree/noetic) to use the Phidget motor drivers (and other sensors in the future). When you build your workspace, in the first run it's normal that build errors will be displayd. Just source your ROS folders and build it agian. The original phidgets_drivers package has been modded. How you replace the sub-folder **phidgets_drivers** with the **phidgets_drivers** folder from this package will be explaind in the further course of this explanation. 
  * [`twist_mux`](https://github.com/ros-teleop/twist_mux) to use and prioritize divers sources of **cmd_vel**
  * [`sick_safetyscanner`](http://wiki.ros.org/sick_safetyscanners) to use the Sick nanoScan 3 in the front of the robot. Please install from source, not from binaries!
  * [`hector_slam`](http://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam)

# Installation
To download and install this package, do the following steps
```console
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/roboTHIx/roboTHIx_X1
```
Compile and source the package
```console
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
$ source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash 

```
Instead of `catkin_make` you can also use [`catkin build`](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html) (which in my opinion is a better tool)

# Replace Phidgets Files
To replace the original phidgets_drivers sub-package with the [modded](https://github.com/roboTHIx/thi_modded_phidgets_drivers) one
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/roboTHIx/thi_modded_phidgets_drivers
$ cd thi_modded_phidgets_drivers
$ chmod +x replace_phidgets_files.sh
$ ./replace_phidgets_files.sh
```
After this, you will be asked if you really want to replace the original phidgets_drivers files. If you answer with "Y" or "y", the files in the ~/catkin_ws/src/phidgets_drivers folder will be replaced.
Bild your workspace again
```console
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

# Usage Instructions
